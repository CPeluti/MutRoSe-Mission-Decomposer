This file is just for defining possible assignments for the Room Preparation example

We have two cleaner robots and two move robots. Also, we have two instances of the RoomCleaning, RobotSanitization and MoveFurniture tasks (RoomA and RoomB).

In this sense we have the following combinations:

-> r1 - RoomCleaning1,SanitizeRobot1 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture1 / r1 - RoomCleaning2,SanitizeRobot2 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture2
-> r1 - RoomCleaning1,SanitizeRobot1 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture1 / r2 - RoomCleaning2,SanitizeRobot2 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture2
-> r2 - RoomCleaning1,SanitizeRobot1 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture1 / r1 - RoomCleaning2,SanitizeRobot2 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture2
-> r2 - RoomCleaning1,SanitizeRobot1 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture1 / r2 - RoomCleaning2,SanitizeRobot2 r3,r4 - MoveFurniture2

Where RoomCleaning1 and MoveFurniture1 represent tasks to be performed at RoomA and RoomCleaning2 and MoveFurniture2 represent tasks to be performed at RoomB
