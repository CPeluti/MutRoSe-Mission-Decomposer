# MRS-Mission-Decomposer
A MRS mission decomposer based on a JSON Goal Model (generated in [GODA](http://pistar-goda.herokuapp.com/)), modified HDDL specification (the original language syntax can be found in [1]), which aims at introducing new constructs to the language, and XML input files. This software is built upon the PANDA HDDL parser (original can be found [here](https://github.com/panda-planner-dev/pandaPIparser)).

## Versions
This is work in progress. The main branch contais partial work under test.

## Installation
To use this modified PANDA parser just clone or download the repository and run it using the following syntax:

./MRSDecomposer [Modified HDDL Domain File] [Goal Model JSON file] [XML configuration file]

## Modified HDDL and Modified Goal Model

A docs folder will be created in order for further explanation of the specification languages used here. As previously noted, this is still work in progress and the author(s) is(are) working in order to provide a complete, stable and well-documented version of this repository.
